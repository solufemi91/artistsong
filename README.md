## Brief

1. create an app using Devise
2. Add a resource to your app to use along side devise (i.e. Posts)
3. Add JS, SCSS (style the Devise Views), Images via asset pipeline
4. need to have 1-many relationship
5. user should be only able to perform crud on their own data
6. pull page with all the ‘posts’ for example
7. when you delete a user it will delete all of the associated records

## What I struggled with

I spent much time trying to establish relationships between the user and songs, however I kept getting roll back messages and I was unsure why. I then realised that it was a combination of things. Firstly, I had to complete an email and a password field and secondly, I forgot to make a user_id column for the resource.

I also came across many error messages that I did not know how to resolve. My only solution was to start the project again. I started over 3 times.


## What went well

I was pleased that I was eventually able to establish relationships between my users and their songs.
